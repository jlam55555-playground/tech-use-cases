An afterthought when making this, but it's not bad to compare text editors and IDEs! Some of these views may be slightly outdated, as I haven't used a hugely diverse set recently (mostly ViM and IntelliJ Ultimat recently).

|Name|Language support|Benefits|Drawbacks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Atom|all|Free; highly hackable (configurable), good plugin support|Can feel a little bulky, some popular packages are sometimes buggy (e.g., terminal, teletype)|
|Brackets|web languages|Free; good support for web languages; ability to view relevant code snippets (e.g., source for CSS class) inline; builtin live web browser development server|Not huge support; was somewhat buggy last time I used it|
|JetBrains (suite)|CLion: C,C++; Goland: Go; IntelliJ Ultimate: all; IntelliJ Community: Java; PyCharm: Python; WebStorm: HTML/CSS/JS; PHPStorm: PHP|Great editors overall with huge feature support; great plugin support; good code suggestion/autocomplete, linting, searching features, etc.; IntelliJ Community is free|most editions are not free to the public (professional licenses are very expensive); heavy resource usage|
|Sublime Text|all|Free; popular and large plugin library; not too resource heavy||
|Visual Studio|all, specialty in .NET|WORKING HERE|WORKING HERE|
|Visual Studio Code (VSCode)|all, specialty in .NET|WORKING HERE|WORKING HERE|
